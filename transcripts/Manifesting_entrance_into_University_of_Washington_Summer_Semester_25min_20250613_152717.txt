## Hemi-Sync Meditation: Manifesting Entrance into University of Washington Summer Semester (25 minutes)

**(1. Introduction/Orientation)**

Welcome. In this journey, we'll explore the power of your mind to manifest your desired reality: acceptance into the University of Washington Summer Semester. We’ll use Hemi-Sync technology and proven visualization techniques to create new neural pathways, aligning your subconscious mind with your conscious intention.  Engage fully with the process, and allow yourself to experience the feeling of already being a UW student.

**(2. Preparation Phase)**

**(a) Energy Conversion Box)**

Imagine a strong, secure box in front of you.  Place any worries, doubts, or distractions inside.  See the lid closing tightly, sealing the box. Know that these things are safely contained and can be retrieved later if needed.  For now, they will not interfere with this journey.

[PAUSE:15]


**(b) Resonant Tuning)**

Gently close your eyes. Begin to breathe deeply, inhaling vibrant energy from the earth, up through your body, gathering in your head.  As you exhale, hum softly, feeling the vibration resonating within you.

[PAUSE:5]

Inhale… gather… exhale… hum…

[PAUSE:10]

Inhale… gather… exhale… hum…

[PAUSE:10]

Inhale… gather… exhale… hum…

**(3. Resonant Energy Balloon)**

Now, visualize energy flowing from the top of your head, cascading down and around your body, like a waterfall of light, entering through your feet and circulating back up. This creates a protective energy field, retaining your personal energy and shielding you from external influences. Feel the warmth and strength of this resonant energy balloon.

[PAUSE:20]


**(4. Affirmation Phase)**

Repeat these affirmations silently, feeling their truth within you:

I am more than my physical body.  I am a powerful creator of my reality.

I am a student at the University of Washington Summer Semester.

I am joyfully engaged in my studies, thriving in the vibrant campus environment.
